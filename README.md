# IfnOS

An experimental operating system project aimed at learning OS development, starting from low-level assembly and C programming. The goal is to build a complete OS over time—including bootloader, kernel, and drivers—while exploring core OS concepts and system programming.

## Build & Run

- Use the provided `Makefile` to build the project.
- The compiled object files are placed in `build/`.
- The final OS images and binaries are placed in `bin/`.

## Notes

- Only source files and build scripts are tracked in Git.
- Build artifacts like `build/` and `bin/` directories are ignored using `.gitignore`.
